### Solidity Smart Contract

![](images_folder/solidity_smart_contract.png)

This project will create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. My smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will include depositing and withdrawing funds from the account.


## Technology

This project leverages Remix IDE to build and test smart contracts created by Solidity 

[Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) is an open source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs.

## Project

steps followed to build the project 

- Creating a Joint Savings Account Contract in Solidity

- Compiling and Deploying the Contract in the JavaScript VM

- Interacting with the Deployed Smart Contract

## Exemples 
here is some exemples of my Interaction with the  Deployed Smart Contract:

- Transaction 1: Send 1 ether as wei

- Transaction 2: Send 10 ether as wei.

-Transaction 3: Send 5 ether.
![Transaction 3: Send 5 ether.](Execution_Results/step1_d5th.png)
- Transaction 4: withdrawing 5 ether into accountOne
